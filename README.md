# Plant Sonification

This repository contains code that converts plant electrophysiology into musical structures. By capturing and analyzing the electrical signals of plants, we can translate these bio-signals into unique and dynamic soundscapes. This project aims to bridge the gap between nature and technology, creating a new way to experience the hidden rhythms of plant life.

## Project Overview

This project involves the sonification of various plant species. The electrophysiological data of the plants are recorded over different periods and then converted into musical structures. Each plant's unique bio-signals are captured, processed, and transformed into sound, allowing us to hear the "music" created by these living organisms.

## üìô Notebook 1 - Temporal Clustering, Melodies, and Spectral Chords üìô

### Objectives

1. **Identify Temporal Patterns**: Use clustering to find patterns in the data over time.
2. **Analyze Spectral Properties**: Examine the spectral centroid and main spectral peaks.
3. **Generate Musical Structures**: Create melodies and chord progressions in MIDI format.

### 1. Temporal Clustering

We use temporal clustering to identify patterns in the electrophysiological data over time, utilizing the spectral centroid as the main feature.

### 2. Spectral Analysis

We analyze the spectral properties of the data:
- **Spectromorphology**: Examining the spectral centroid.
- **Extraction of Spectral Peaks**: Identifying the main spectral peaks using two different methods (EMD, cepstrum).

### 3. Melodies and Chord Progressions in MIDI

We translate the analyzed data into musical structures:
- **Melody Generation**: Mapping the spectral centroid across segments.
- **Chord Progression**: Using the main spectral peaks in each segment to create chord progressions.

## üìí Notebook 2 - Spectromorphological Curves üìí

### Objectives

1. **Extract Spectral Features**: Analyze key spectral features from plant signals.
2. **Generate Curves**: Create curves showing how these features change over time.
3. **Control Parameters for DAWs**: Use the curves to control music software.

### 1. Load and Normalize Data

Import and normalize plant signal data to ensure consistency.

### 2. Extract Features

Calculate spectral centroid, bandwidth, and flux across time to understand the spectral characteristics of the plant signals.

### 3. Create Curves

Generate and smooth curves from these features to highlight significant trends and patterns.

### 4. Export Curves

Save the generated curves as files for use in Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs), enabling them to be used as control parameters for music production.
