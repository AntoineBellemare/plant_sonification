# Plant Sonification

This repository contains code that converts plant electrophysiology into musical structures. By capturing and analyzing the electrical signals of plants, we can translate these bio-signals into unique and dynamic soundscapes. This project aims to bridge the gap between nature and technology, creating a new way to experience the hidden rhythms of plant life.

## Project Overview

This project involves the sonification of various plant species. The electrophysiological data of the plants are recorded over different periods and then converted into musical structures. Each plant's unique bio-signals are captured, processed, and transformed into sound, allowing us to hear the "music" created by these living organisms.

## Captations

The following list outlines the plants studied during Spring 2024.

1. **Acer rubrum**

2. **Rhododendron groenlandicum**
   
3. **Dryopteris mas**

4. **Polystichum acrostichoides**

5. **Alnus**

6. **Geum rivale**

7. **Myrica gale**

8. **Acer pensylvanicum**
